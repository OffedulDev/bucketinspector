Hello Inspector, as you may have noticed yesterday some people were [b]bringing legal

liquid coming in the kingdom[/i] [b][color=green]MUST meet a specific weight
restriction[/b][/color] if it is too heavy [color=red][u]THEY MUST BE DECLINED![/u][/color]

You can find the new regulation in your [color=teal]Rulebook[/color] by pressing [b]R[/b]
